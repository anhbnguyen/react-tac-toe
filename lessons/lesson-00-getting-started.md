## Background

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), a command line utility built by Facebook (the creator of React) that makes it easy to quickly start building a single page app using React.

The HTML and CSS for this Tic Tac Toe game was borrowed from https://codepen.io/roykatsiri/pen/vbegh and tweaked to conform to the general practices of an app built using React.

## Before Getting Started

While running commands using `npm` is supported, create-react-app console messages reference `yarn` commands so it may be easier to follow along if you install Yarn onto your computer before we get started - [Yarn Installation](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).

## Setting Up

To get started, clone this repository onto your computer.
```
git clone https://github.com/joeynguyen/react-tac-toe.git
```

Change your directory to this repo:
```
cd react-tac-toe
```

Install package dependencies:
```
yarn install
```

## Running the App and Making Changes

Begin running the app:
```
yarn start
```

This project has already been bootstrapped for you to begin making changes and seeing your changes being reflected in the UI right when you save thanks to the live reload feature built into create-react-app. Feel free to try it out for yourself.

In the next few lessons, we'll be focusing on making changes mainly to the `src/App.js` file.
