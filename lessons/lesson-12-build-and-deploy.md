## Build and Deploy

To build a production ready version of your app, run:

```yarn build```

For deploying your app to the web, refer to Facebook's [create-react-app documentation](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#deployment) for a variety of options for deployment.

My recommendation is to use [Github Pages](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#github-pages) because it's tied to your Github account and the URL is easy to remember.
